        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">I am a final year PhD researcher with expertise in remote sensing, geospatial analysis and geophysical field techniques applied to environmental research. I have a background in Physical Geography with a strong foundation in Python and GIS, a track record in academic publishing and experience working in remote field environments.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">My PhD research looks at the evolution of ice within deglaciating mountain landscapes in Central Asia using integrated remote sensing and geophysical methods.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-weight: 500;">I am looking for opportunities in geospatial analysis and environmental management after completing my PhD in spring / summer 2026.</p>
