I am a final year PhD researcher with expertise in remote sensing, geospatial analysis and geophysical field techniques applied to environmental research. I have a strong foundation in Python and GIS, a track record in academic publishing and experience working in remote field environments.

My PhD research looks at the evolution of ice within deglaciating mountain landscapes in Central Asia using integrated remote sensing and geophysical methods.

I have a background in Physical Geography and am in interested in interdisciplinary and policy orientated science. I am looking for opportunities in geopsatial analysis and environmental management after completing my PhD in spring / summer 2026.
